      Rock is a broad genre of popular music that originated as "rock and roll"
      in the United States in the late 1940s and early 1950s, developing into a
      range of different styles from the mid-1960s, particularly in the United
      States and the United Kingdom.[3] It has its roots in 1940s and 1950s rock
      and roll, a style that drew directly from the blues and rhythm and blues
      genres of African-American music and from country music. Rock also drew
      strongly from genres such as electric blues and folk, and incorporated
      influences from jazz, classical, and other musical styles. For
      instrumentation, rock has centered on the electric guitar, usually as part
      of a rock group with electric bass guitar, drums, and one or more singers.
      Usually, rock is song-based music with a 4/4 time signature using a
      verse-chorus form, but the genre has become extremely diverse. Like pop
      music, lyrics often stress romantic love but also address a wide variety
      of other themes that are frequently social or political. Rock was the most
      popular genre of music in the U.S. and much of the Western world from the
      1950s to the 2010s.
