## Personal website 
This repository is a github page consists of code for my website that I had made as a part of the course "Into to Software Systems", which focused on webdev.
The main languages used were HTML, CSS and Javascript.
The main parts of this website are:
- An about yourself page
- Educational background, achievements and skills
- Blogs

---
The website is responsive,i.e, it adjusts to the dimensions of the device, and also has a dark mode feature. 

The Blogs section is quite unique, as it also records the viewers comments and likes.

This website has also been hosted on the researchweb.iiit.ac page.
